Rinchen Gyalpo and Sangay Duba were the first democratically elected Jurmey Gup and Mangmi, respectively.
The Gewog received its powerline in 2013, allowing for the distribution of electricity to every home, and by 2015, the road connection had been completed, facilitating easy mobility. Prior to then, hourses were needed to transport necessities from Gyalpozing back to the settlement, which took four days.
